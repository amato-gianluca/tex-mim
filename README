tex.mim
=======

libm17n mim file for for TeX-style input - derived from the latin-ltx.el Quail
package by TAKAHASHI Naoto <ntakahas@m17n.org> and Dave Love <fx@gnu.org>.

Install by copying tex.mim to /usr/share/m17n/
Optionally, copy   TeX.png to /usr/share/m17n/icons/

Choose an input method framework that will supports the M17N Input Method
Engine (ibus, scim, uim). After a reboot, the tex input method should be
available in your chosen input engine.


XCompose Alternative
====================

Also included is a simple script which will convert the mim file to an
XComponse configuration file in case you would rather use your compose key.

    mim2xcompose.pl tex.mim >> ~/.XCompose

If you feel that the leading backslash for the tex commands are redundant,
you can pass the --strip-backspash option to the script and they will be
excluded.
